## Features:
* Highly aggressive & polished skill-emulation engine offering unparalleled smoothness and the lowest skill delays attainable: far surpassing NGSP, PR, free SP and Bern script in speed, responsiveness and fluidity.
* Choice of either skill speed up or animation cancelling, or combination of the two. The system automatically ensures that you don’t lose damage or runemarks.
* Instant runemarks with optional, customizable delay system.
* A much faster backstab when you're facing the boss. The angle is customizable since this backstab doesn't turn the camera. The "slower" camera-turning backstab is still twice as quick as normal.
* Instant Leaping Slash resets.
* Full Runeburst damage when out of Ragnarok or Godsfall.
* Lightweight AutoHotkey integration in order to ensure the camera-turning backstab always turns the camera.
* Instant cooldown system. Gameplay is substantially more responsive and intuitive at all ping types, even at low ping.
* Fully client-side skills including Charge & Backstab.
* Backstab prevention when boss isn't targetable.
* The polish and fluidity of over a year's worth of emulation & core development.
* Trust in a developer who has a track record of quality and dedication: who works continually to improve their modules and provide the best experience.
* Client-side effect icons (e.g. Gungnir's Bite).
* Anti-bodyblock alternative that works universally.
* Zero desync - completely accurate location system.
* Instant effect icons (e.g. Gungnir’s Bite)
* Integrated fps tax & client latency skill speed compensation.
* In-built custom boss ping remover.
* dynamicStabilityMode gives complete control over the stability of the module. The aim with this mode is to allow the option of a stabilized experience for users with unstable net.
* External ping method for more accurate ping values.
* Prevention of desync between boss model and boss’s position.
* Full control over all features and many additional configuration options.
